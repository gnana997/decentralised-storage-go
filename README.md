#Decentralised Storage (Go)
 This is a decentralized storage application written in Go. It allows users to store files in a decentralized way across multiple nodes in a peer-to-peer network.

#Features
- Decentralized file storage - Files are split into fragments, encrypted and stored across multiple nodes in the network. There is no central point of failure.
- File redundancy - Files can be replicated to multiple nodes for redundancy. If a node goes offline, the file can still be retrieved from other nodes.
- Secure - All files are encrypted before being stored. Only the user with the right key can decrypt and access the files.
- Open source - This project is open source and transparent. Anyone can use it or contribute to it.


#Getting Started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

#Prerequisites
- Go 1.11 or higher
- Git

#Installing
-Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/gnana997/decentralised-storage-go

-Navigate to the project directory:
    cd decentralised-storage-go

#Build the project:
- go build


This will create an executable decentralised-storage-go file that can be run.

#Run the app:
    ./decentralised-storage-go

This will start the decentralized storage node.

#Usage
TODO: After completing Add instructions for how to use the decentralized storage. Such as:
